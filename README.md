# DBFZ-MOD-ENABLER

To run this, you will need to build KDMAPPER (https://github.com/TheCruZ/kdmapper)
Then you need to compile and drag the sys file into kdmapper, the user mode exe is what you will be running

TODO: MAKE IT A DRIVER ONLY SOLUTION

Scribbed instructions:

rename all paks to pxks

use kdmapper with the driver file (needs to be done after each PC restart, uninstall faceit anticheat to prior usage, only play games like apex, fortnite, rust, valorant after rebooting your pc, or you'll risk a ban)

(run user mode app) <-- maybe this step can be omitted (needs further testing)

launch game

wait for error message

run user mode app

click ok in the game's error message

open the game again and wait for the patch

all set (edited)
