# DBFZ-MOD-ENABLER

**OUTDATED (FOR THE MOMENT)**

To run this, you will need to build KDMAPPER (https://github.com/TheCruZ/kdmapper)
Then you need to compile and drag the sys file into kdmapper, the user mode exe is what you will be running

Scribbed instructions:

rename all paks to pxks

launch game

wait for error message

use kdmapper with the driver file (needs to be done after each PC restart, uninstall faceit anticheat to prior usage, only play games like apex, fortnite, rust, valorant after rebooting your pc, or you'll risk a ban)

restart your PC when you want to play games like the ones mentioned above

click ok in the game's error message

all set (the patch is persistent until reboot)

open the game
